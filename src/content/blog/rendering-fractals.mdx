[Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) have interested me since I was very young. I've always been fascinated by the idea of self-similarity, and the fact that you can zoom in infinitely on a fractal and still see the same pattern. They seem like a glitch in the universe -- given a small and finite set of rules, you can generate seemingly infinite complexity. How does $ z \to z^2 + c $ create the above image?

These are some various renderings of fractals that I've done, using software I've written

## Software

  * [fractalrender](https://github.com/chemicaldevelopment/fractalrender), a program I've written (and rewritten FAR too many times...) to render high quality images/videos of fractals
  * [fractalexplorer](https://github.com/simplesummit/fractalexplorer): a realtime
    * check out a [YouTube video made with it](https://youtu.be/vUrKn34JoRg)
    * check out the [blog post about it](https://simplesummit.github.io/blog/fractalexplorer)
